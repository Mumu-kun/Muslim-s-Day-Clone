# Muslim-s-Day-Clone
This is my iGraphics Project for BUET Level 1 Term 1.
This app
- displays the waqt, sehri, iftar schedule of today
- view waqt, sehri, iftar schedule for any day selected from a calendar
- countdown until next waqt (plays azan) and sehri/iftar time
- includes a reminder functionality and alarm
- supports playback of all 114 surahs of Qur'an.

Download the "muslims-day-clone.zip" file from 'releases', extract and run the iMain.exe.

If you want to avoid downloading the 1.3GB file, you can download the "muslims-day-clone(without-surah).zip" file which omits the surah playback functionality.

Here's a video that explains the functionality : https://youtu.be/49qQ2JR9Luc
