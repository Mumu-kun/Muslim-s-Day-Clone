# Muslim-s-Day-Clone
This is my iGraphics Project for BUET Level 1 Term 1.
This app
- displays the waqt, sehri, iftar schedule of today
- view waqt, sehri, iftar schedule for any day selected from a calendar
- countdown until next waqt (plays azan) and sehri/iftar time
- includes a reminder functionality and alarm
- supports playback of all 114 surahs of Qur'an.

Download the full "muslims-day-clone.zip" from this drive link :
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1anNStNnOw7OpINOT5moAJdh-uyuNydxW/view?usp=share_link

Or,

There is a smaller "muslims-day-clone.without-surah.zip" file in "releases", which omits the surah audio files and surah playback functionality.

Extract the zip, run the iMain.exe inside.

Here's a video that explains the app functionality : https://youtu.be/49qQ2JR9Luc
